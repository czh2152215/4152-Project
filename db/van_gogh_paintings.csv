1,Shoes,Vincent van Gogh,1888,"Van Gogh painted several still lifes of shoes or boots during his Paris period. This picture, painted later, in Arles, evinces a unique return to the earlier motif. However, here Van Gogh has placed the shoes within a specific spatial context: namely, the red-tile floor of the Yellow House. Not only may we identify the setting, but perhaps the owner of the shoes as well. It has been suggested that this ""still life of old peasants' shoes"" may have been those of Patience Escalier, whose portrait Van Gogh executed around the same time, late summer 1888.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1947.jpg
2,Self-Portrait with a Straw Hat (obverse: The Potato Peeler),Vincent van Gogh,1887,"Van Gogh produced more than twenty self-portraits during his Parisian sojourn (1886–88). Short of funds but determined nevertheless to hone his skills as a figure painter, he became his own best sitter: ""I purposely bought a good enough mirror to work from myself, for want of a model."" This picture, which shows the artist's awareness of Neo-Impressionist technique and color theory, is one of several that are painted on the reverse of an earlier peasant study.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1502_cropped2.jpg
3,Irises,Vincent van Gogh,1890,"In May 1890, just before he checked himself out of the asylum at Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh painted four exuberant bouquets of spring flowers, the only still lifes of any ambition he had undertaken during his yearlong stay: two of irises, two of roses, in contrasting color schemes and formats. In the Museum’sIriseshe sought a “harmonious and soft” effect by placing the “violet” flowers against a “pink background,” which have since faded owing to his use of fugitive red pigments. Another work from this series,Roses(1993.400.5), hangs in the adjacent gallery. Both were owned by the artist’s mother until her death in 1907.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP346474.jpg
4,"La Berceuse (Woman Rocking a Cradle; Augustine-Alix Pellicot Roulin, 1851–1930)",Vincent van Gogh,1889,"Of the five versions of Van Gogh’s portrait of Augustine Roulin, wife of his friend the postmaster of Arles, the present canvas is the one the sitter chose for herself. Van Gogh remarked that ""she had a good eye and took the best."" He began the portraits just before his breakdown in Arles, in December 1888, and completed them in early 1889, calling them ""La Berceuse,"" meaning ""lullaby, or woman who rocks the cradle,"" indicated by the rope held in the sitter’s hand, which is attached to the unseen cradle.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-19279-001.jpg
5,"L'Arlésienne: Madame Joseph-Michel Ginoux (Marie Julien, 1848–1911)",Vincent van Gogh,1888–89,"While in Arles, Van Gogh painted two very similar portraits of Marie Ginoux, the proprietress of the Café de la Gare, wearing the regional costume of the legendary dark-haired beauties of Arles. The first version, which he described in a letter of November 1888 as ""an Arlésienne . . . knocked off inonehour,"" must be the more thinly and summarily executed portrait in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris. In it a parasol and gloves lie on the table instead of books. This portrait belonged to the sitter until she sold it in 1895.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1396.jpg
6,Wheat Field with Cypresses,Vincent van Gogh,1889,"Cypresses gained ground in Van Gogh’s work by late June 1889 when he resolved to devote one of his first series in Saint-Rémy to the towering trees. Distinctive for their rich impasto, his exuberant on-the-spot studies include the Met’s close-up vertical view of cypresses (49.30) and this majestic horizontal composition, which he illustrated in reed-pen drawings sent to his brother on July 2. Van Gogh regarded the present work as one of his “best” summer landscapes and was prompted that September to make two studio renditions: one on the same scale (National Gallery, London) and the other a smaller replica, intended as a gift for his mother and sister (private collection).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1567.jpg
7,Madame Roulin and Her Baby,Vincent van Gogh,1888,"This vigorously painted portrait of Augustine Roulin and her infant daughter, Marcelle, is one of Van Gogh’s many evocative renderings of the Roulin family, undertaken some six months after the artist relocated from Paris to Arles. Van Gogh painted the entire family of the local postman Joseph Roulin. Here, the chubbycheeked infant is the focus of the enterprise. Her heightened expression in thickly painted brushwork suggests that the baby may have posed for van Gogh, swaddled in her mother’s embrace. Augustine Roulin, by contrast, is an abbreviated presence.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/rl/original/DT3154.jpg
8,Oleanders,Vincent van Gogh,1888,"For Van Gogh, oleanders were joyous, life-affirming flowers that bloomed ""inexhaustibly"" and were always ""putting out strong new shoots."" In this painting of August 1888 the flowers fill a majolica jug that the artist used for other still lifes made in Arles. They are symbolically juxtaposed with Émile Zola'sLa joie de vivre, a novel that Van Gogh had placed in contrast to an open Bible in a Nuenen still life of 1885.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1494.jpg
9,The Flowering Orchard,Vincent van Gogh,1888,"The arrival of spring in Arles in 1888 found Van Gogh ""in a fury of work."" As he wrote to his brother Theo, ""the trees are in blossom and I would like to do a Provençal orchard of tremendous gaiety."" Between late March and late April, the artist dedicated fourteen canvases to the subject, working in a range of sizes, formats, and styles. This composition, dominated by the angular, elongated branches of the budding trees, attests to Van Gogh’s admiration for Japanese prints. His inclusion of the scythe and rake makes this one of only two orchard paintings to hint at a human presence.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14936-045.jpg
10,The Potato Peeler (reverse: Self-Portrait with a Straw Hat),Vincent van Gogh,1885,"This painting from February/March 1885, with its restricted palette of dark tones, coarse facture, and blocky drawing, is typical of the works Van Gogh painted in Nuenen the year before he left Holland for France. His peasant studies of 1885 culminated in his first important painting,The Potato Eaters(Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1503.jpg
11,Sunflowers,Vincent van Gogh,1887,"Van Gogh painted four still lifes of sunflowers in Paris in late summer 1887. There is an oil sketch for this picture (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) as well as another painting of two sunflowers also signed and dated 1887 (Kunstmuseum Bern), and a larger canvas showing four sunflower heads (Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo). Paul Gauguin acquired the two smaller works, and until the mid-1890s, when he sold his most prized possessions to finance his South Seas voyage, they held pride of place above the bed in his Paris apartment.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP229743.jpg
12,Women Picking Olives,Vincent van Gogh,1889,"At the end of 1889, Van Gogh painted three versions of this picture. He described the first as a study from nature ""more colored with more solemn tones"" (private collection) and the second as a studio rendition in a ""very discreet range"" of colors (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). The present work, the most resolved and stylized of the three, was intended for his sister and mother, to whom Van Gogh wrote: ""I hope that the painting of the women in the olive trees will be a little to your taste—I sent [a] drawing of it to Gauguin, . . . and he thought it good. . . .""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-17161-001.jpg
13,Olive Trees,Vincent van Gogh,1889,"This is one of five pictures of olive orchards that Van Gogh made in November 1889. Painted directly from nature but animated by Seurat-like stippling and stylized passages of broken color, these works responded to recent compositions by Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard. ""What I’ve done is a rather harsh and coarse realism beside their abstractions,"" Van Gogh observed, ""but it will nevertheless impart a rustic note, and will smell of the soil.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1946.jpg
14,"First Steps, after Millet",Vincent van Gogh,1890,"In fall and winter 1889–90, while a voluntary patient at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh painted twenty-one copies after Millet, an artist he greatly admired. He considered his copies ""translations"" akin to a musician's interpretation of a composer's work. He let the black-and-white images—whether prints, reproductions, or, as here, a photograph that his brother, Theo, had sent—pose ""as a subject,"" then he would ""improvise color on it."" For this work of January 1890, Van Gogh squared-up a photograph of Millet'sFirst Stepsand transferred it to the canvas.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP124808.jpg
15,Peasant Woman Cooking by a Fireplace,Vincent van Gogh,1885,"This work was made in Nuenen in late spring 1885, just after Van Gogh completedThe Potato Eaters(Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam), in the same dark hues that reminded the artist of ""green soap"" or ""a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course."" Van Gogh was ""convinced that in the long run it produces better results to paint [peasants] in their coarseness than to introduce conventional sweetness… If a peasant painting smells of bacon, smoke, potato steam—fine—that’s not unhealthy—if a stable smells of manure—very well, that’s what a stable’s for.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT2163.jpg
16,Cypresses,Vincent van Gogh,1889,"Cypresseswas painted in late June 1889, shortly after Van Gogh began his yearlong stay at the asylum in Saint-Rémy. The subject, which he found ""beautiful as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk,"" both captivated and challenged the artist: ""It’s thedarkpatch in a sun-drenched landscape, but it’s one of the most interesting dark notes, the most difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine."" One of two close-up views of the ""very tall and massive"" trees in a vertical format (the other is in the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo),Cypresseswas shown in the 1890 Salon des Indépendants.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP130999.jpg
17,Road in Etten,Vincent van Gogh,1881,"In 1881 van Gogh briefly resided in Etten, where he produced a number of drawings of local peasants and laborers performing routine, humble tasks. This masterful work, in which a man with a broom is seen sweeping a street lined with pollard willows, is a characteristic example.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/rl/original/DP359031.jpg
18,Bouquet of Flowers in a Vase,Vincent van Gogh,1890,"This still life is not mentioned in Van Gogh’s letters and has puzzled scholars as to its place in his artistic production. The subject enjoys a certain rapport with the mixed bouquets of summer flowers he made in Paris; the quasi-abstract floral wallpaper design in theBerceuseof Arles (1996.435), and the white porcelain vase in theIrisesof Saint-Rémy (58.187). However, the palette and style of this painting, especially its distinctive blues and ochers and graphic, brick-shape hatchings, link it firmly with the landscapes made just prior to his death in Auvers on July 29, 1890.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT7098.jpg
19,Roses,Vincent van Gogh,1890,"On the eve of his departure from the asylum in Saint-Rémy in May 1890, Van Gogh painted an exceptional group of four still lifes, to which both The Met'sRosesandIrises(58.187) belong. These bouquets and their counterparts—an upright composition of irises (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) and a horizontal composition of roses (National Gallery of Art, Washington)—were conceived as a series or ensemble. Traces of pink along the tabletop and rose petals in the present painting, which have faded over time, offer a faint reminder of the formerly more vivid ""canvas of pink roses against a yellow-green background in a green vase.""This painting was seized by the Nazis from Georg Simon Hirschland (1885–1942) in Essen in 1939, following Hirschland's emigration to the United States in 1938. It was restituted to his heirs in New York in 1950.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP346475.jpg
20,Corridor in the Asylum,Vincent van Gogh,September 1889,"Struggles with his mental health led Van Gogh to admit himself to the psychiatric hospital of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, located in the Romanesque monastery of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole. Throughout his twelve-month confinement, he continued to paint. In addition to the picturesque wheat fields, olive groves, cypresses, roses, and irises in and around the monastery, he captured this interior view of one of the asylum’s corridors. Despite his colorful palette, the sharply receding corridor feels hollow and haunted. Van Gogh sent the drawing to his brother Theo to give him an impression of his new surroundings. His time in the asylum did not afford the cure the artist had hoped for, and he died by suicide shortly thereafter.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DT365509.jpg
21,Nursery on Schenkweg,Vincent van Gogh,April–May 1882,"Van Gogh's first commission came from his uncle Cornelis Marinus, an art dealer, for drawings of views of the Hague, where he was then living. This large view of a nursery close to Van Gogh's studio was among those he sent to Marinus in May 1882.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP108508.jpg
22,Street in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer,Vincent van Gogh,"ca. July 15, 1888","In the summer of 1888, Van Gogh, who was then living in Arles, made a trip to the small Mediterranean fishing village of Saintes-Maries de la Mer, where he made a painted view of this street with its thatched roofs and smoking chimneys. This drawing was one of fifteen that were sent, in the month of July alone, to Van Gogh's friend, the artist Émile Bernard, in Brittany, to keep Bernard up to date on the work he was doing. In these vibrant drawings, Van Gogh captured the essence of the paintings while creating the compositions anew in a different medium.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP108504.jpg
23,Wheat Field,Vincent van Gogh,July 1888,,https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP108507.jpg
24,Vincent Van Gogh on his Deathbed,Dr. Paul Ferdinand Gachet,ca. 1890,"Dr. Paul Gachet, the amateur artist and doctor in whose care Vincent Van Gogh spent his final months in Auvers-sur-Oise, made several drawings of the deceased painter following his suicide, on which he based this print. It is a somber counterpart to the lively etched portrait of Gachet made by Van Gogh only weeks earlier (2021.243). Gachet signed his works “Van Ryssel”—deriving the name from his birthplace near Lille (“Ryssel” in Flemish)—and encouraged a number of artists, including Van Gogh, to try etching by sharing access to the press in his home. This impression is dedicated to Louis Lumet, an anarchist writer, who co-founded an organization called L’Art pour tous (Art for All) in 1901, whom Gachet likely met through Socialist circles.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP-28286-001.jpg
25,Burning Weeds,Vincent van Gogh,"mid-July, 1883","In July 1883, Van Gogh decided to try his hand at lithography for a second time. This is one of two prints he produced that summer on a scale he hoped would cater to illustration projects. The subject reveals his early interest in the work of the renowned French painter of peasant subjects, Jean-François Millet. In 1881, he read Alfred Sensier’s biography of Millet, which illustrates a sheet of sketches featuring a woman burning weeds. The standing figure poking the fire in the background is reminiscent of illustrations in the Sensier volume. For this work, he used a fine pen on smooth transfer paper and encountered some difficulty with the fidelity of the transfer to the lithographic stone and subsequent printing. Consequently, he touched up the print extensively with pen and ink.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP-22759-001.jpg
26,Gardener by an Apple Tree,Vincent van Gogh,"mid-July, 1883","In July 1883, Van Gogh decided to try his hand at lithography for a second time. This is one of two prints he produced that summer along with ""Burning Weeds"" (2021.242). For these works, he used a fine pen on smooth transfer paper and encountered some difficulty with the fidelity of the transfer to the lithographic stone and subsequent printing. Consequently, he touched up the print extensively with pen and ink, most evident here in the dark knots of the tree. His inspiration for the subject was a scene he observed and sketched while visiting a retirement home, which he later restaged with the help of his favorite model from the period, Adrianus Jacobus Zuyderland. The artist treated the motif of the peasant laborer digging repeatedly at this time. It highlights his appreciation for the French painter Jean-François Millet, whose composition ""The Diggers"" (57.531.18) he copied as early as November 1880.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP-22758-001.jpg
27,The Zouave,Vincent van Gogh,"ca. June 20, 1888","During a spell of torrential rain that interrupted his harvest series (June 20–24), Van Gogh made his first real effort at portraiture in Arles. Two days into his campaign, he announced to Theo: ""I have a model at last—a Zouave—a boy with a small face, a bull neck, and the eye of the tiger."" The present work served as a color study for his bust-length portrait of the dashing young soldier. In the oil painting, Van Gogh heightened the ""savage combination of incongruous tones,"" fleshed out the character's likeness, and placed him in a convincing setting. That July he sent the watercolor, with dedicatory inscription, to his ""comrade Émile Bernard.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP108506.jpg
28,At Eternity's Gate,Vincent van Gogh,"November 26−27, 1882","Lithography fascinated Van Gogh early in his career, but he made very few prints due to financial constraints. ""At Eternity’s Gate"" is one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882. His ambition was to publish a series of thirty prints in order disseminate his work to a broad audience and to earn the attention of magazine editors in the hope of receiving commissions as an illustrator. This print stands out among the group for the spiritual weight the artist attached to it, evoked by the combination of the title with the despairing pose of the model. It remained meaningful to him throughout his career: he brought an impression with him to Paris and went to the trouble of having it framed. Then, in 1890 while in the asylum in Saint-Rémy, he made apaintingbased on the print (Kröller-Müller Museum). It is the only one of his prints that he copied in oil.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP-22757-001.jpg
29,Portrait of Doctor Gachet or Man with a Pipe,Vincent van Gogh,1890,"Van Gogh made this print—his only etching—just six weeks before his death. In May 1890, Van Gogh left the asylum in Saint-Rémy for Auvers-sur-Oise, where he was under the care of Dr. Paul Ferdinand Gachet. The doctor was an amateur etcher, who signed his works ""Van Ryssel."" He provided Van Gogh with an etching plate and needle and the opportunity to use the press in his home. The artist chose to etch Gachet’s portrait, which he also painted twice in oil (Private Collection, Tokyo and Musée d’Orsay, Paris). This impression is inscribed on the inside of the folded sheet as an artist’s proof printed by Van Ryssel/Gachet and is richly inked and selectively wiped. Van Gogh expressed enthusiasm for the medium and wrote to his brother Theo of his desire to continue to collaborate with Gachet to create more etchings based on his paintings from the south of France. Regrettably, his death by suicide on July 29, 1890 prevented him from realizing the project.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP-22761-001.jpg
30,Aristotle with a Bust of Homer,Rembrandt (Rembrandt van Rijn),1653,"Among the most celebrated works of art at The Met, this painting conveys Rembrandt’s meditation on the meaning of fame. The richly clad Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) rests his hand pensively on a bust of Homer, the epic poet who had attained literary immortality with hisIliadandOdysseycenturies before. Aristotle wears a gold medallion with a portrait of his powerful pupil, Alexander the Great—perhaps the philosopher is weighing his own worldly success against Homer’s timeless achievement. Although the work has come to be considered quintessentially Dutch, it was painted for a Sicilian patron at a moment when Rembrandt’s signature style, with its dark palette and almost sculptural buildup of paint, was beginning to fall out of fashion in Amsterdam.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP319026.jpg
31,Woman Combing Her Hair,Edgar Degas,ca. 1888–90,"This is the second of two variants of a composition that Degas created about 1885 (State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg). In this version, he used a new technique, applying pastel in so many successive layers that the pigment became burnished and the underlying paper rubbed to such an extent that the fibers were loosened and now project from the surface like many little hairs. Degas also emphasized anti-natural chartreuses and greens in modeling the figure’s pink flesh, perhaps inspired by the play of complementary color contrasts in the work of such younger contemporaries as Seurat or Van Gogh.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1917.jpg
32,The Denial of Saint Peter,Caravaggio (Michelangelo Merisi),1610,"Caravaggio’s late works, painted in Naples, depend for their dramatic effect on brightly lit areas standing in contrast to nearly black backgrounds. This painting, a marvel of narrative concision, was painted in the last months of Caravaggio’s life and marks an extreme stage in his revolutionary style. Standing before a fireplace, Peter is accused of being a follower of Jesus. The pointing finger of the soldier and two fingers of the woman allude to the three accusations and to Peter’s three denials. In 1613 this painting belonged to the artist Guido Reni, who received it from the engraver Luca Ciamberlano as compensation for debts.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-12413-001.jpg
33,The Funeral,Edouard Manet,ca. 1867,"Manet’s unfinished painting is thought to depict the funeral of the writer Charles Baudelaire, which took place on September 2, 1867. The artist, unlike other friends who had yet to return from vacation or stayed away owing to the threatening summer storm, was among the few mourners present. This view of the meager funeral cortège at the foot of the Butte Mouffetard, a hill in southwest Paris, is framed by the silhouettes of the towers and cupolas of the Val de Grâce, the Panthéon, Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, and the Tour de Clovis in the background.Manet kept the picture until his death. In 1894 Pissarro acquired it in exchange for one of his own landscapes.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1931.jpg
34,"The ""Kearsarge"" at Boulogne",Edouard Manet,1864,"During the American Civil War, the United States warshipKearsargemade headlines after sinking the Confederate raiderAlabamaoff the coast of France. Manet did not witness firsthand the widely-covered event but devoted two paintings to the subject: a scene of the naval battle (Philadelphia Museum of Art) and this picture, prompted by his subsequent visit to the victorious ship at anchor near Boulogne. They were his first depictions of a current event.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-25464-001.jpg
35,"Antoine Dominique Sauveur Aubert (born 1817), the Artist's Uncle",Paul Cézanne,1866,"In the autumn of 1866, Cézanne undertook a series of paintings of his maternal uncle, Dominique Aubert, in different costumes. Here, he dons a robe and tasseled blue cap. In another work in The Met’s collection, he poses as a monk (1993.400.1). A friend reported: ""Every day there appears a [new] portrait of him."" Cézanne applied his paint directly with a palette knife on the coarsely woven canvas, giving these pictures what he called a ""gutsy"" character.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1408.jpg
36,Christ Asleep during the Tempest,Eugène Delacroix,ca. 1853,"Delacroix painted at least six versions of this New Testament lesson in faith: when awakened by his terrified disciples, Christ scolded them for their lack of trust in Providence. In the earlier works, the seascape is more prominent; in the later ones, as here, Christ’s bark occupies a more significant place. After Vincent van Gogh saw this version in Paris in 1886, he wrote, ""Christ’s boat—I’m talking about the blue and green sketch with touches of purple and red and a little lemon yellow for the halo, the aureole—speaks a symbolic language through color itself.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14343-001.jpg
37,The Return to the Fold,Anton Mauve,,"Mauve was a leading member of the Hague school, the Dutch counterpart to the Barbizon school of painters in France. He painted everyday subjects drawn from his local landscape in southwest Holland. This work depicts one of Mauve’s favorite and most popular subjects, a shepherd and his flock. Prices varied depending on whether the picture featured ""sheep coming,"" or, as here, the slightly less expensive ""sheep going."" Vincent van Gogh, who was the cousin of Mauve’s wife, studied with Mauve in the winter of 1881–82, and admired him as ""a great interpreter of the fine gray Dutch countryside.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-23076-001.jpg
38,The Toilet of Bathsheba,Rembrandt (Rembrandt van Rijn),1643,"Rembrandt shows the biblical figure Bathsheba completely nude, lost in a moment of contemplation and unaware that she is being observed by King David in the distant tower in the background. Many contemporary critics objected to Rembrandt’s realistic representation of the female body, declaring that the marks of garters could be seen on the legs of his figures from history or myth—see Bathsheba’s left calf here. Much of the picture is badly abraded from past cleaning, including the attendant arranging Bathsheba’s hair, who may have been intended to represent a woman of African descent.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP145915.jpg
39,The Garden of the Tuileries on a Winter Afternoon,Camille Pissarro,1899,"In December 1898 Pissarro wrote from Paris that he had ""engaged an apartment at 204 rue de Rivoli, opposite the Tuileries, with a superb view of the garden, the Louvre to the left, in the background the houses on the quays behind the trees, to the right the Dôme des Invalides, and the steeples of Sainte-Clotilde behind clumps of chestnut trees. It’s very beautiful. I shall have a fine series to paint."" During the following winter and spring he painted eight cityscapes looking toward the Louvre, and six, like this one, of the Tuileries Gardens with Sainte-Clotilde in the background.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1559.jpg
40,"A Cowherd at Valhermeil, Auvers-sur-Oise",Camille Pissarro,1874,"This view shows one of the roads connecting the hamlet of Valhermeil in Auvers with Pontoise, the village northwest of Paris where Pissarro lived for many years. Between 1873 and 1882, he painted some twenty works in this area, several featuring the same red-roofed house. The subject, villagers walking on paths through the French countryside, was one of the artist’s favorites, reflecting his interest in the pulse of daily rural life. Made in 1874, the year of the first Impressionist exhibition, this picture demonstrates Pissarro’s adaptation of the looser touch, broken brushstrokes, and lighter palette of younger colleagues like Monet.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1556.jpg
41,A Bashi-Bazouk,Charles Bargue,1875,"The figure depicted here is a mercenary of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish term for him isbashi-bazouk, which translates as “headless.” These men fought for plunder, an association that gave Bargue license to employ his virtuosic painting technique to paint finery such as the silk garments andnarghile, or water pipe.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-29211-001.jpg
42,Haystacks: Autumn,Jean-François Millet,ca. 1874,"This picture is from a series depicting the four seasons commissioned in 1868 by the industrialist Frédéric Hartmann. Millet worked on the paintings intermittently for the next seven years. InAutumn, with the harvest finished, the gleaners have departed and the sheep are left to graze. Beyond the haystacks lie the plain of Chailly and the rooftops of Barbizon. The loose, sketchlike finish of this work is characteristic of Millet's late style: patches of the dark lilac-pink ground color are deliberately exposed, and the underdrawing is visible, particularly in the outlines of the haystacks and the sheep.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP124093.jpg
43,Woman from the French Colonies,Charles-Henri-Joseph Cordier,1861,"Charles cordier combined two personal interests —  the new science of ethnography and polychrome sculpture —  to produce an entirely original category of work. In 1848, following training at the Petite École (École Spéciale de Dessin et de Mathématiques) in Paris and with the sculptor François Rude, he exhibited, when only twenty-one, at the Paris Salon. His first submission, a plaster bust of Saïd Abdallah of the Darfour tribe, coincided with the abolition of slavery in France and its colonies, established by law on April 27 of that year. In his unpublished ""Mémoires,"" he wrote, ""My art incorporated the reality of a whole new subject, the revolt against slavery and the birth of anthropology."" [1] Three years later, he was named ethnographic sculptor to the Musée d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and in that capacity he traveled to Algeria (1856), Greece (1858 – 59), and Egypt (1865). Sketches and models made during the voyages inspired a series of portraits of the people of those and other countries that would become the mainstay and lasting achievement of his career.As a young student in Paris, Cordier was also aware of the ongoing academic debate as to whether ancient Greek and Roman sculpture was colored or not. Antoine-Chrysostome Quatremère de Quincy’s reconsideration of the fifth-century-b.c. gold-and-ivory statue of Olympian Jupiter (destroyed) had brought about a more accurate knowledge of polychromy in antique art when published in 1814.[2] Ancient Roman statues composed of variously colored marbles, such as the Old Fisherman (also known as Dying Seneca; Musée du Louvre, Paris), and Renaissance mixed-media works by Nicolas Cordier, such as Moor (ca. 1600, now Versailles), both then at the Palais du Louvre, drew his attention. [3] His 1856 mission to Algeria gave him the opportunity to study African physical types; on that trip he also found onyx deposits in recently reopened ancient quarries and, inspired by historical example, began to use the material in his sculpture. The Negro of the Sudan (1856, Musée d’Orsay, Paris) was the first work in which he fit a bronze head into an onyx bust and turban. Cordier was not alone in his taste for color in sculpture: his contemporary Jean-Léon Gérôme in France and the younger Vincenzo Gemito in Italy and Alfred Gilbert in England were similarly inclined. But Cordier was the most consistent in combining colored sculpture and ethnographic subjects.Cordier’s most lavish multimedia busts of ethnic people found favor with collectors at the highest social level, for example, Napoléon III and Queen Victoria, who were no doubt drawn to them because of their own colonialist interests. [4] For such costly commissions he would create a model that could be varied with different stones and paints. The Goat Tender of the Colonies (La Capresse des Colonies), for instance, features a brilliantly striated chunk of Algerian onyx-marble that evokes a vibrantly colored costume; it contrasts with the darkly patinated bronze head and shoulders that are inserted into the stone. Smooth flesh and nubbly hair are set off by gold and enameled earrings. For another version of The Goat Tender, in the Musée d’Orsay, Paris, Cordier selected a less variegated marble for the drapery and he complemented its golden hue by gilding the turban. [5]The Goat Tender’s alert, upturned face and coquettish smile contrast with the sober, downturned countenance of The Jewish Woman of Algiers (La Juivre d’Alger). For the latter, a predominantly white onyx-marble is matched with a white enamel fired into the bronze floral pattern of the blouse. Brightly colored enamels make stripes in the turban and in the brooches that pin it to the hair. Inset amethyst eyes gleam against the smooth surface of the woman’s bronze skin. For a different version in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Troyes, Cordier used red enamel for the blouse, which he matched by painting part of the marble cloak red and gold. [6] For grand sculptures such as these, he delighted in varying the colors and effects.As Cordier’s busts were increasingly sought by collectors, he began to create pairs, generally male and female, as decorative ensembles. The Goat Tender (first version exhibited in 1861) was paired with The Negro of the Sudan (first shown in 1856) in an exhibition in London in 1862. [7] The Jewish Woman of Algiers was paired after 1866 with The Arab Sheik of Cairo, in examples in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, and in two now-lost pairs.[8] By contrast, the Metropolitan’s group presents a same-​sex pair representing different countries and races of the African continent.The Museum’s two busts were exhibited in 1863 in the Exposition de la Société Artistique des Bouches-du-Rhône, Marseilles, and purchased there by the Cercle des Phocéens, a gentlemen’s gambling club in that city.[9] The first owners of the busts may have viewed them as decorative representations of the opposite sex, but Cordier’s idea in creating them was to illustrate the universality of beauty. In his words, ""Because beauty is not the province of privileged race, I give to the world of art the idea of the universality of beauty. Every race has its beauty, which differs from that of other races. The most beautiful Negro is not the one who looks most like us, nor the one who presents the most pronounced characteristics associated with his race. It is the individual in whom are united such forms and traits, and a face that reflects with harmony and balance the essential moral and intellectual character of the Ethiopian race."" [10]At the time of their purchase, the Cercle des Phocéens acquired pedestals for the busts, evidently based on designs by Charles-François Rossigneux. These neo-Rococo matching pedestals in red and white marble are decorated with gilt-bronze decorations of sprays of flowers —  one with horn, flute, panpipes and thyrsus, the other with torch and bow. Cordier used this design for other pedestals. Having himself designed a number of torchères and atlantids to ornament interiors in the Second Empire style, he was mindful of the need to integrate his sculpture with the decor of the room where it would stand. As he wrote in 1864, ""Polychrome sculpture is not made for gardens, but for interiors that are already lavish."" [11]Footnotes1.

44,Flowers in a Blue Vase,Adolphe Monticelli,1879–1883,"Monticelli painted hundreds of pictures with heavily textured, richly colored surfaces, but his still lifes, all of which were painted between 1879 and 1883, were most admired. Cézanne was fascinated by his work, as was Van Gogh, who wrote to his brother that ""Monticelli sometimes made a bunch of flowers as an excuse for gathering together in a single panel the whole range of his richest and most perfectly balanced tones... you must go straight to Delacroix to find anything equal to his orchestration of tones.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT2791.jpg

Although dated 1866, the picture was likely undertaken in 1865, when the two men painted together at the French seaside resort of Trouville; Courbet wrote of ""the beauty of a superb redhead whose portrait I have begun.""

The classicizing, pyramidal format of this composition lends a certain grandeur to the sitter, attired in the costume that the couturier Poiret designed for her role as Eliza Doolittle in George Bernard Shaw’sPygmalionin 1913.

This plaster group is the working model for the commission of 1867 for the imperial palace at Fontainbleau.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/original/DP244023.jpg
48,Jupiter and the Sphinx,Auguste Préault,1868,"This group is the sculptor's working model for one of two monumental stone sculptures completed in 1870 and still in the garden of the palace at Fontainbleau.

49,Mask from Libro di Variate Mascare,René Boyvin,1560,"In 1555, the printmaker Frans Huys made a set of eighteen engravings of masks after designs by the sculptor Cornelis Floris, which were published in Antwerp by Hans I Liefrinck. A delirious amalgam of marine, plant, and human features, Floris’s grotesque masks illustrate the early modern fascination with the monstrous and possibly allude to Antwerp’s sea trade. They were inspired by art from ancient Rome as well as the artistic vocabulary developed by artists working at the French royal palace of Fontainebleau. The French influence is seen most clearly in the mask composed of architectural forms, including sculptural strapwork, cartouches, and scalloped niches.Various copies were soon made after the series by Floris and Huys, demonstrating the popularity of such masks across Europe. This print belongs to an Italian set of twenty-four signed with the monogram IHS. In addition to copies after Floris, the set included six original designs. It was likely acquired by the French printmaker René Boyvin, who published the designs under his own name with a title page. Boyvin himself produced numerous prints inspired by the decorations at Fontainebleau for an expanding market of artists and collectors.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP889669.jpg
50,"Woman of Algiers [originally titled ""The Jewish Woman of Algiers""]",Charles-Henri-Joseph Cordier,1862,"In his unpublished memoirs Charles Cordier cites the law of April 27, 1848 that abolished slavery in France and its colonies, writing: ""My art incorporated the reality of a whole new subject, the revolt against slavery and the birth of anthropology.""  In pioneering ethnography as a subject for sculpture in the nineteenth century, Cordier aimed to illustrate what he described as ""the idea of the universality of beauty.""  His busts often paired couples of the opposite sex but of the same race.  This rare instance of matched busts of women (see also La Capresse des Colonies, 2006.112) was desired by the purchaser, a gaming club in Marseilles, that also commissioned the sumptuous Second-Empire pedestals from Cordier.The busts revel in the period taste for polychromy in sculpture, an international phenomenon sparked by artistic debates about the painting of ancient statuary and inspired by ancient Roman and Renaissance sculpture composed of variously colored marbles.  On a trip to Algeria in 1856 Cordier discovered onyx deposits in recently reopened ancient quarries and began to use the stone in busts such as these.  He ingeniously fitted enameled bronze heads into the vibrantly patterned stone, creating exciting though costly representations of Africans that appealed to the highest levels of European society.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/original/DP250149.jpg

The depiction of individuals, interrupted at tasks amid settings that reveal clues about their character, was developed by Degas in numerous figure paintings of the 1860s and early 1870s.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-25461-001.jpg

The women’s suggestive attitudes—and Warrener’s ear, reddened in embarrassment—indicate the risqué nature of their conversation.

The sitter is probably the wife of the artist’s schoolboy friend Paul Valpinçon; Degas immensely enjoyed outings to their country house, Ménil-Hubert, and the dahlias, asters, and gaillardias in the bouquet would suggest a late summer visit.

Here, he amplifies the subject of a lithograph made some ten years earlier: the hardship and quiet fortitude of third-class railway travelers. Bathed in light, the nursing mother, elderly woman, and sleeping boy emanate a serenity not often associated with public transport.

Rejected from the Salon of 1863, both paintings were included in the Salon des Refusés that same year.

73,Pedestal [for Woman from the French Colonies],Charles-Henri-Joseph Cordier,1861,"Charles cordier combined two personal interests —  the new science of ethnography and polychrome sculpture —  to produce an entirely original category of work. In 1848, following training at the Petite École (École Spéciale de Dessin et de Mathématiques) in Paris and with the sculptor François Rude, he exhibited, when only twenty-one, at the Paris Salon. His first submission, a plaster bust of Saïd Abdallah of the Darfour tribe, coincided with the abolition of slavery in France and its colonies, established by law on April 27 of that year.

75,Eclectus Roratus Polychloros,Edward Lear,ca. 1830–32,"Known as a landscape painter and a writer of nonsense verse, Lear began his career as an ornithological draftsman. This work records male and female Eclectus parrots, a species native to Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia. The bird is unique for its distinct plumage-predominantly green in males, red and blue in females. The design was made for one of the lithographs in ""Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots,"" the first book devoted to a single bird species, which the artist published between 1830 and 1832. Preparatory to making the prints, Lear sketched live specimens and bird skins at the London Zoological Society, then transferred selected images to lithographic stones for printing. The final step was to color the prints by hand.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP821097.jpg
76,Alphonse Promayet (1822–1872),Gustave Courbet,1851,"Promayet, a violinist who was a childhood friend and schoolmate of Courbet's, appears in several paintings by the artist. Here, he holds his instrument while adopting a soulful expression befitting a struggling musician. This picture served as the model for Promayet's likeness inThe Painter’s Studioof 1855 (Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Courbet borrowed it back from the sitter, as he did many other portraits used for the life-size canvas.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1958.jpg
77,A Man Reading in a Garden (recto); Preliminary sketch for a Man Reading in a Garden (verso),Honoré Daumier,ca. 1865,"After Daumier's death, this drawing came into the hands of the Paris art dealers Boussod & Valadon, where Vincent Van Gogh's brother, Theo, worked. Vincent seems to have recalled seeing it, writing to his brother on October 22, 1882:""I remember very well being most impressed by a drawing of Daumier's: an old man under the chestnut trees in the Champs Elysées. . . . What impressed me so much at the time was something so stout and manly in Daumier's conception, something that made me think it must be good to think and to feel like that and to overlook or ignore a multitude of things and to concentrate on what makes us sit up and think and what touches us as human beings more directly and personally than meadows or clouds.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP824210.jpg
78,"The Ballet from ""Robert le Diable""",Edgar Degas,1871,"When Degas made this picture in 1871, Giacomo Meyerbeer’s operaRobert le Diablewas forty years old and feeling its age—as reflected by the man at center, indifferent to the action and directing his binoculars at the audience. But Degas was fond of the opera, and particularly of the scene depicted here, from the third act, in which nuns arise from the dead and dance seductively amid the ruins of a moonlit monastery. The painting was exhibited in early 1872, the date inscribed on the canvas; Degas later executed a larger version (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) for Jean-Baptiste Faure, who starred in the opera.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1911.jpg

80,The Birth of Venus,Alexandre Cabanel,1875,"The first version of Cabanel'sBirth of Venus(Musée d'Orsay, Paris) created a sensation at the Salon of 1863, which was dubbed the ""Salon of the Venuses"" owing to the number of alluring nudes on view. The Salon picture was purchased by Napoleon III for his personal collection. In 1875, New Yorker John Wolfe commissioned the present, slightly smaller, replica from Cabanel. The composition embodies ideals of academic art: mythological subject, graceful modeling, silky brushwork, and perfected form. This style was perennially popular with collectors, even as it was challenged by artists seeking a more personal interpretation of truth to nature, such as Courbet.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-22432-001.jpg
81,Girl in the Dunes,Jozef Israëls,mid-19th–early 20th century,"Israëls was one of the most important artists of the Hague School, a term coined by a critic in 1875 to describe a group of artists working in a new realist manner. Like the Post-Impressionists, these artists shared friendships more than common artistic purpose. This beautiful watercolor of a girl looking out to sea was inspired by the impoverished fishermen and their families whom Israëls first encountered in 1855 at Zantvoort and Katwijk. The simplicity of the composition ennobles this girl and creates a melancholy mood. The drawing recalls Millet's sympathetic representations of peasants, which Israëls would have known from his trip to Paris and Barbizon in 1853.In Israëls's portrayal of the poor families of fishermen, Van Gogh found the same sympathetic dignity that characterizes Millet's peasant farmers. ""When Israëls, or, say, Daumier or Lhermitte, draws a figure,"" Vincent wrote Theo (in July 1885), ""one gets much more of a sense of the shape of the body, and yet . . . the proportions will sometimes be almost arbitrary, the anatomy and structure often anything but correct in the eyes of the academicians. But it will live."" Colta Ives",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP800935.jpg
82,Woman Having Her Hair Combed,Edgar Degas,ca. 1886–88,"No doubt Degas intended to include this work in the 1886 Impressionist exhibition among the nudes he described in the catalogue as ""women bathing, washing themselves, combing their hair or having it combed,"" since it is his only pastel of the mid-1880s of a woman having her hair combed. Executed in large format and meticulously finished, this nude—reminiscent of Rembrandt’s famousBathsheba at Her Bathin the Louvre—may not have been completed in time for the exhibition, or else it may have been excluded deliberately for reasons unknown.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP253480.jpg

This is Seurat’s first nocturnal painting and the first to depict popular entertainment. It represents theparade, or sideshow, of the Circus Corvi at the annual Gingerbread Fair, held in eastern Paris around the place de la Nation, in spring 1887. Sideshows were staged outside the circus tent, for free, to entice passersby to purchase tickets. The onlookers at the far right are queued on stairs leading to the box office.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP375450_cropped.jpg
84,Sleep,Pierre Puvis de Chavannes,ca. 1867–70,"This is a smaller replica of an 1867 painting (Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille) that Puvis regarded as his ""favorite work."" He associated the composition with a fragment from theAeneidby the ancient Roman poet Virgil: ""It was the hour when the first rest of weary mortals begins"" (book 2, line 268). The text refers to a brief (and illusory) respite from war, but Puvis portrays untroubled repose after harvesting. By depicting sleepers of all ages, ranging from an old man to a mother cradling her baby, the artist creates an image of communal rest and protection.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14201-033.jpg
85,At the Milliner's,Edgar Degas,1882,"Two customers in nearly identical dresses—perhaps a mother and daughter or two sisters—are seen from behind in a millinery shop. This pastel may have been conceived originally as a picture of a shopgirl (at left) adjusting a hat on a stand. However, once Degas drew the woman underneath the hat at the right and added the back of the sofa, the identity of the figure at the left was transformed; shopgirls were not allowed to sit.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1046.jpg
86,The Sofa,Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec,ca. 1894–96,"Lautrec set out to document the lives of prostitutes in a series of pictures executed between 1892 and 1896. At first he made sketches in brothels, but he was apparently hampered by insufficient lighting and had his models pose in his studio. He appreciated the naturalness of sitters like this lesbian couple, ""who stretch themselves out on the divans…entirely without pretensions."" The candid image may take its cue from Degas’s monotypes of brothel scenes and erotic Japanese prints.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1924.jpg
87,The Good Samaritan,Domenico Fetti,ca. 1618–22,"At the end of his life, about 1618–22, Fetti executed, for the Ducal collection at Mantua, a number of small paintings of parables. Most of these exist in a number of versions, and were reproduced in Fetti's shop. Autograph paintings by Fetti of ""The Good Samaritan"" exist in Dresden and in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

88,"Washerwoman, Study",Camille Pissarro,1880,"Most of the works that Pissarro submitted to the 1882 Impressionist exhibition were figure paintings in which the local villagers who had routinely animated his rural landscapes assumed monumental form, indicating a shift in his artistic focus. Pissarro's neighbor in Pontoise, a fifty-six-year-old mother of four named Marie Larchevêque, sat for this work, which was shown asLaveuse, étude (Washerwoman, Study).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-21955-001.jpg
89,"Study for ""A Sunday on La Grande Jatte""",Georges Seurat,1884,"This is Seurat’s final study for his monumental painting of Parisians at leisure on an island in the Seine (Art Institute of Chicago). Contrasting pigments are woven together with small, patchy brushstrokes, whereas in the mural-sized park scene—which debuted two years later at the 1886 Impressionist exhibition—Seurat used tighter, dot-like dabs of paint, a technique which came to be known as Pointillism (from the French wordpoint, or dot). He preferred the term Divisionism—the principle of separating color into small touches placed side-by-side and meant to blend in the eye of the viewer.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP259921.jpg
90,Soap Bubbles,Jean Siméon Chardin,ca. 1733–34,"From a glass of soapy water, a young man blows a bubble, its iridescent, translucent surface caught in the sunlight. A child peers eagerly over the ledge without breaking the atmosphere of silent concentration. In earlier Northern European painting, this subject carried a moralizing message about the transience of life; however, Chardin’s canvas moves the register from the allegorical to the everyday. Chardin became famous for miraculous surface effects achieved through rough yet refined paint application, as seen in the central figure’s jacket, locks, forehead, and hands. He made copies of his most successful compositions: later versions of Soap Bubbles belong to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and to the National Gallery of Art, Washington. This painting was seized by the Nazis from Jane Mannheimer in Paris and illegally purchased for the Führer Museum in 1944. It was returned to France by the Service Français de la Récupération following an agreement with the Netherlands Art Property Foundation and was restituted in or after 1948.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP356133.jpg
91,Pedestal [Woman of Algiers],Charles-Henri-Joseph Cordier,1862,"In his unpublished memoirs Charles Cordier cites the law of April 27, 1848 that abolished slavery in France and its colonies, writing: ""My art incorporated the reality of a whole new subject, the revolt against slavery and the birth of anthropology.""  In pioneering ethnography as a subject for sculpture in the nineteenth century, Cordier aimed to illustrate what he described as ""the idea of the universality of beauty.""  His busts often paired couples of the opposite sex but of the same race.  This rare instance of matched busts of women (see also La Capresse des Colonies, 2006.112) was desired by the purchaser, a gaming club in Marseilles, that also commissioned the sumptuous Second-Empire pedestals from Cordier.The busts revel in the period taste for polychromy in sculpture, an international phenomenon sparked by artistic debates about the painting of ancient statuary and inspired by ancient Roman and Renaissance sculpture composed of variously colored marbles.  On a trip to Algeria in 1856 Cordier discovered onyx deposits in recently reopened ancient quarries and began to use the stone in busts such as these.  He ingeniously fitted enameled bronze heads into the vibrantly patterned stone, creating exciting though costly representations of Africans that appealed to the highest levels of European society.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/es/original/SF2006_113d.jpg
92,The Dead Christ with Angels,Edouard Manet,1864,"Manet identified the source for this painting, the first of several religious scenes, in the inscription on the rock: the Gospel according to Saint John. However, in the passage cited, Christ’s tomb is empty except for two angels. After Manet sent the canvas to the 1864 Salon, he realized that he had made an even greater departure from the text, depicting Christ’s wound on the wrong side. Despite Charles Baudelaire’s warning that he would ""give the malicious something to laugh at,"" the artist did not correct his mistake. Indeed, critics denounced the picture, particularly the realism of Christ’s cadaverous body.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-17679-001.jpg
93,James-Jacques-Joseph Tissot (1836–1902),Edgar Degas,ca. 1867–68,"The fashionable painter James Tissot was Degas’s friend and mentor in the 1860s and early 1870s. Posed in a studio, top hat and satin-lined cape by his side, Tissot is surrounded by canvases that reflect the wide-ranging tastes he shared with Degas: an exotic, Japanese-style picture; scenes of contemporary leisure; and behind the easel, a sixteenth-or-seventeenth-century Venetian subject. At center, a copy after a portrait of Frederick the Wise in the Louvre, formerly attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder, pays homage to Northern Renaissance art.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-25462-001.jpg

95,Young Lady in 1866,Edouard Manet,1866,"Manet’s model, Victorine Meurent, had recently posed as the brazen nudes inOlympiaandLuncheon on the Grass(both Musée d’Orsay, Paris). Here, appearing relatively demure, she flaunts an intimate silk dressing gown. Critics eyed the painting as a rejoinder to Courbet’sWoman with a Parrot(29.100.57) and as indicative of Manet’s ""current vice"" of failing to ""value a head more than a slipper."" Recent scholars have interpreted it as an allegory of the five senses: the nosegay (smell), the orange (taste), the parrot-confidant (hearing), and the man’s monocle she fingers (sight and touch).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP273977.jpg
96,A Road in Louveciennes,Auguste Renoir,ca. 1870,"This picture, which is in effect drawn directly with paint, was almost certainly executed out-of-doors about 1870. The site is in the village of Louveciennes, west of Paris, where Camille Pissarro lived and worked in 1869-70 and was inspired to paint the same motif, but from a different vantage point (National Gallery, London). At the time, Renoir was staying nearby with his parents, who had retired to Voisins.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP265242.jpg
97,The Natchez,Eugène Delacroix,1823–24 and 1835,"In 1823, Delacroix began to paint this scene from Chateaubriand’s widely read Romantic novelAtala, which narrates the fate of the Natchez people following attacks by French forces in the 1730s. After putting the canvas aside for about a decade, he finally completed the picture for the Paris Salon of 1835. In the catalogue, Delacroix provided this explanatory note: ""Fleeing the massacre of their tribe, two young savages traveled up the Mississippi River. During the voyage, the woman was taken by pain of labor. The moment is that when the father holds the newborn in his hands, and both regard him tenderly.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14345-001.jpg
98,The Death of Socrates,Jacques Louis David,1787,"In this landmark of neoclassical painting from just before the French Revolution, David took up a classical story of resisting unjust authority in a sparse, friezelike composition. The Greek philosopher Socrates (469–399 BCE) was convicted of impiety by the Athenian courts; rather than renounce his beliefs, he died willingly, expounding on the immortality of the soul before drinking poisonous hemlock. Through a network of gestures and expressions, David’s figures act out the last moments of Socrates’s life. He is about to grasp the cup of hemlock, offered by a disciple who cannot bear to witness the event. David consulted antiquarian scholars to create an archeologically exacting image, including details of furniture and clothing. His inclusion of Plato at the foot of the bed, however, deliberately references not someone present at Socrates’s death but rather the author whose text,Phaedo, preserved this ancient story.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-13139-001.jpg
99,The Forest at Pontaubert,Georges Seurat,1881,"Seurat spent two months in the late summer and early fall of 1881 in Pontaubert, a village southeast of Paris once frequented by Daubigny, Corot, and other Barbizon landscape painters. His visit inspired thissous-boisor forest glade, which Seurat probably completed that winter in the studio he shared with his traveling companion and fellow artist Aman-Jean. With its concert of greens, its subtle, shimmering light effects, and its vertical pattern of tree trunks, this work anticipates the verdant settings of Seurat’s monumentalBathers at Asnièresin London (1884) andA Sunday on La Grande Jattein Chicago (1884–86).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT2165.jpg
100,The Forest in Winter at Sunset,Théodore Rousseau,ca. 1846–67,"Unrivaled for its scale and ambition, this monumental forest scene was begun early in Rousseau's career and remained unfinished at the time of his death, despite the urging of Millet and other artist friends to complete and exhibit it. By one account, Rousseau’s intention was to recreate the effect of a sunset he had seen in Bas-Bréau, a section of Fontainebleau forest, in December 1845. The tangled web of trees, denuded of foliage and suffused with deep color, conveys a sense of awe before nature that is amplified by the presence of two stooped peasants at the center.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP247630.jpg

102,The Sea,Gustave Courbet,1865 or later,"During successive sojourns at Trouville in the mid-1860s, Courbet fully developed the pictorial vocabulary that he used for his distinctive minimalist views of the sea and sky under different conditions of light and weather. This ""sea landscape"" (paysage de mer), as he called such works, may have been painted along the Normandy coast between 1865 and 1867, or it may be a later studio repetition.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-24650-001.jpg
103,"Border Designs for the Mortlake ""Acts of the Apostles"" Tapestries",Franz Cleyn,ca. 1626–36,"These two large watercolors represent the design for the right and left side of the border of a tapestry. They were designed by Franz (Francis) Cleyn for the Mortlake Manufactory to frame the famous ‘Acts of the Apostles’ tapestries, created after the original cartoons designed by Raphael which had been purchased by King Charles while still Prince of Wales (seven survive and are now at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London). The designs for the border are at reduced scale, but they are worked out in great detail. The decorations consist of cartouches in which various scenes from the Old and New Testament have been depicted in bronze and orange tones, possibly to simulate cameos. Most scenes correspond with the finished tapestry, but some have been given a new location or were replaced all together. In between the cartouches, putti are depicted holding up coats of arms with symbolic imagery. The corner of the frame are decorated with the symbols of the Four Evangelists, accompanied by putti holding up books. The figures in the drawings betray the influence of the celebrated Flemish artists Sir Anthony Van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens, and the cartouche designs reflect popular contemporary ornament prints, published by artists such as the Italian printmaker Agostino Mitelli.It is presumed that these drawings functioned as presentation drawings, shown to King Charles I for his approval, prior to the production of the tapestries. Indeed, King Charles I owned a set of the tapestries, which were woven between 1626 and 1636 and eventually sold after his death. They were purchased by the French minster of state Abel Servien. In 1659, they were acquired by Cardinal Mazarin, and subsequently entered the Royal Collection under King Louis XIV. The tapestry for which these borders were designed survives to this day in the Mobilier National.Franz Cleyn is considered one of the most significant artists working in England in the first half of the seventeenth century, and forms a link in the chain of British court artists from Hans Holbein the Younger and Inigo Jones to James Thornhill, whose career flourished after the reparation of the monarchy. While Cleyn designed for a range of media, he is best known as the designer of tapestries for the factory at Mortlake. He retained his association with Mortlake even under the Commonwealth.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP-22581-001.jpg
104,Still Life with Apples and Pears,Paul Cézanne,ca. 1891–92,"Cézanne once proclaimed, ""With an apple I want to astonish Paris,"" and he succeeded, even in his most deceptively simple still lifes, to dazzle and delight. Turning to the Provençal apples and Beurré Diel pears grown in the vicinity of the family’s estate near Aix, he dispensed with traditional one-point perspective and examined the fruit, plates, and table from various viewpoints—straight on, above, and sideways.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14936-049.jpg
105,The Baker's Cart,Jean Michelin,1656,"Michelin’s subjects relate to those by more famous artists, the Le Nain brothers, who also posed members of lower society in such deadpan, direct address. Unlike most painters in the 1600s, Michelin chose to depict peasants in an urban context where various goods are offered for sale, including fresh bread and medicinal eau‑de‑vie. His care in rendering tattered shoes anticipates Vincent van Gogh’s poetic still lifes from the 1880s, in which worn-out footwear attests to physical labor borne day in and day out.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP366472.jpg
106,The Hamlet of Optevoz,Charles-François Daubigny,ca. 1852,"This peaceful evening scene is based on drawings Daubigny made in 1852 at Optevoz, a town in the valley of the river Rhône that he had first visited in 1849. The painting appears to be a straightforward description of things seen. Yet Daubigny is thought to have sacrificed finish and detail in order to imbue the modest subject with a poetic effect.One of the sketches on which this view is based is also in The Met's collection. A painting of 1857 in the Philadelphia Museum of Art shows the view in different light and from a slightly greater distance.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT332111.jpg

109,Armor,Odilon Redon,1891,"This fantastical drawing of a helmeted woman in profile is one of four similar charcoal drawings Redon executed during the last decade of the nineteenth century.  The sitter, rendered strangely mute by her helmetlike covering and untouchable by its thorny needles, varies slightly from sheet to sheet.  While the exact meaning of Redon's image is unclear, it has been thought that the bizarre bondage imposed on his sitter expresses subconscious fear of female sexuality or, conversely, serves as a symbol of female fecundity.  Equally important, however, is Redon's virtuoso handling of charcoal and his ability to capture its full range of tones, from the dark velvet quality of the helmet to the pallor of the woman's skin.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP139626.jpg
110,Mask from Libro di Variate mascare,René Boyvin,1560,"In 1555, the printmaker Frans Huys made a set of eighteen engravings of masks after designs by the sculptor Cornelis Floris, which were published in Antwerp by Hans I Liefrinck. A delirious amalgam of marine, plant, and human features, Floris’s grotesque masks illustrate the early modern fascination with the monstrous and possibly allude to Antwerp’s sea trade. They were inspired by art from ancient Rome as well as the artistic vocabulary developed by artists working at the French royal palace of Fontainebleau. The French influence is seen most clearly in the mask composed of architectural forms, including sculptural strapwork, cartouches, and scalloped niches.Various copies were soon made after the series by Floris and Huys, demonstrating the popularity of such masks across Europe. This print belongs to an Italian set of twenty-four signed with the monogram IHS. In addition to copies after Floris, the set included six original designs. It was likely acquired by the French printmaker René Boyvin, who published the designs under his own name with a title page. Boyvin himself produced numerous prints inspired by the decorations at Fontainebleau for an expanding market of artists and collectors.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP889668.jpg
111,The Siesta,Paul Gauguin,ca. 1892–94,"The unaffected grace and communal ease of Tahitian women impressed Gauguin enormously. The artist worked on this painting over an extended period, incorporating numerous changes. The skirt of the woman in the foreground, for example, was originally bright red; there was a dog in the position now occupied by the basket at lower right; and the woman seated at the left edge of the porch was previously situated further to the left.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1952.jpg

Preceded by several preparatory studies, including two drawings and a pastel, which are also in the Museum's collection, the work was favored by Mary Cassatt, who remarked: ""It is much in the style of a Vermeer and quite as interesting, very quiet and reposeful. It is a beautiful picture.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-25620-001.jpg
113,"Jalais Hill, Pontoise",Camille Pissarro,1867,"This view of Pontoise, just northwest of Paris, helped establish Pissarro’s reputation as an innovative painter of the rural French landscape. The critic Émile Zola praised the picture enthusiastically when it was shown along with another rustic scene at the Salon of 1868, writing, ""This is the modern countryside. One feels that man has passed by, turning and cutting the earth. . . . And this little valley, this hill have a heroic simplicity and forthrightness. Nothing would be more banal were it not so grand.

114,Young Woman (La Servante),Auguste Renoir,ca. 1875,"The title Renoir conferred on this painting is untraced. By 1885 it was on the market asLa Servante, and for many years afterward the subject was identified, erroneously, as a waitress in the popular Parisian restaurant called Duval’s. Whatever her role, Renoir imparted to his comely model an unaffected grace. As he once said, ""I like painting best when it looks eternal without boasting about it: an everyday eternity, revealed on the street corner: a servant-girl pausing a moment as she scours a saucepan, and becoming a Juno on Olympus.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1488.jpg
115,Still Life with Flowers and Prickly Pears,Auguste Renoir,ca. 1885,"This picture is closely related toStill Life: Flowers, 1885 (Solomon R.

Featuring an autumnal bouquet and Cézannesque arrangement of prickly pears, the present still life was likely painted the same year, in the wake of a visit with Cézanne that summer. At this time, Renoir sought to combine the luminosity of Impressionism with a greater degree of classicism, prompting him to explore techniques that would emulate the dry, light colors of Italian frescoes, which have led to some surface cracks.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP257756.jpg
116,Two Tahitian Women,Paul Gauguin,1899,"The canvases that Gauguin sent back to France from the South Seas reflect the license he exercised in fashioning images of Indigenous women. Here, he channeled classicizing nudes, while relying on gesture and facial expression to evoke the ideal ""Tahitian Eve"" conjured in his writings: ""very subtle, very knowing in her naïveté"" and enviably ""capable of walking around naked without shame."" Whispering confidences, offering exotic blossoms or (forbidden) fruit, the women inhabit a tropical Eden of Gauguin’s invention, in which his artistic vision—and male gaze—hold sway. These two figures also appear in his monumental worksFaa Iheihe (Tahitian Pastoral), 1898; (Tate, London) andRupe Rupe (The Fruit Harvest), 1899; (Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1342.jpg
117,"Gray Weather, Grande Jatte",Georges Seurat,ca. 1886–88,"This view extends from the island of La Grande Jatte, framed by trees, to the red-roofed houses of the Paris suburb of either Asnières or Courbevoie across the Seine. Seurat had earlier celebrated this stretch of the river with his ambitious compositionsBathers at Asnières(1883–84, National Gallery, London) andA Sunday on La Grande Jatte(1884–86, Art Institute of Chicago). Here he sought ""to transcribe most exactly the vivid outdoor clarity [of nature] in all its nuances"" using a technique known as Divisionism (also called Pointillism). The painted border was added shortly before the picture was first exhibited in 1889.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1945.jpg

120,Joan of Arc,Jules Bastien-Lepage,1879,"Joan of Arc, the medieval teenaged martyr from the French province of Lorraine, gained new status as a patriotic symbol when France ceded part of the territory to the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). Bastien-Lepage, a native of Lorraine, depicts the moment when Saints Michael, Margaret, and Catherine appear to the peasant girl in her parents’ garden, rousing her to fight the English invaders in the Hundred Years War. Critics at the Salon of 1880 praised Bastien-Lepage’s use of pose and facial expression to convey Joan’s spiritual awakening, but found the inclusion of the saints at odds with his naturalistic style.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14201-049.jpg
121,Auti Te Pape,Paul Gauguin,1893–94,"Gauguin began working on the text and illustrations for Noa Noa (Fragrant Scent) while in Paris in 1893-94 following his first voyage to Tahiti. The project was originally conceived as a narrative of Gauguin's personal and artistic perceptions of Tahiti but ultimately became something much more complex and mysterious, full of references to Tahitian creation myths and ancient Maori culture. Gauguin designed ten woodblock prints for Noa Noa, which function less as illustrations than as inspired corollaries: they bear little relationship to his romanticized autobiographical text, nor do they seem to follow any particular sequence. However, the imagery and themes of the prints - love and fear, creation and death, day and night - are in keeping with much of Gauguin's Tahitian oeuvre.This print shows a female nude seated on a riverbank; a second woman with raised arms prepares to plunge into the river in the background. Images of beautiful young women bathing or lounging beside bodies of water reappear throughout Gauguin's Tahitian oeuvre. While this image was not meant as a literal illustration of the text of Noa Noa, it resonates with a section of the first chapter which describes women bathing their legs in the Fatana River.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DT306424.jpg
122,Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley,Paul Cézanne,1882–85,"The distinctive silhouette of Mont Saint-Victoire rises above the Arc River valley near the town of Aix. To paint this scene, Cézanne stood close to Montbriand, his sister’s property, at the top of the hill just behind her house; the wall of the neighboring farmhouse is barely visible. Cézanne sought to reveal the inner geometry of nature, ""to make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of museums."" Indeed the railroad viaduct that cuts through this pastoral scene is evocative of a Roman aqueduct, recalling paintings by Nicolas Poussin.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-20099-001.jpg
123,The Brioche,Edouard Manet,1870,"Manet reportedly called still life the ""touchstone of the painter."" From 1862 to 1870 he executed several large-scale tabletop scenes of fish and fruit, of which this is the last and most elaborate. It was inspired by the donation to the Louvre of a painting of a brioche by Jean Siméon Chardin, the eighteenth-century French master of still life. Like Chardin, Manet surrounded the buttery bread with things to stimulate the senses—a brilliant white napkin, soft peaches, glistening plums, a polished knife, a bright red box—and, in traditional fashion, topped the brioche with a fragrant flower.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-13655-001.jpg

125,The Bay of Naples,Auguste Renoir,1881,"The corner of the balcony visible at lower left in this composition indicates Renoir’s vantage point overlooking the bay of Naples. His position afforded an iconic view of the harbor with the volcano Mount Vesuvius in the background, wafting smoke into the sky. Inspired by the southern Italian light, Renoir painted another version of this vista at a different time of day (The Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Mass.). James Duncan, a wealthy sugar refiner, purchased the present work in 1883, making it the first Impressionist picture acquired by a Scottish collector.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1878.jpg
126,Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary),Paul Gauguin,1891,"Before embarking on a series of pictures inspired by Polynesian religious beliefs, Gauguin devoted this, his first major Tahitian canvas, to a Christian theme, describing it in a letter of March 1892: ""An angel with yellow wings reveals Mary and Jesus, both Tahitians, to two Tahitian women, nudes dressed in pareus, a sort of cotton cloth printed with flowers that can be draped from the waist. Very somber, mountainous background and flowering trees . . . a dark violet path and an emerald green foreground, with bananas on the left. I'm rather happy with it."" Gauguin based much of the composition on a photograph he owned of a bas-relief in the Javanese temple of Borobudur.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1025.jpg
127,Lachrymae,"Frederic, Lord Leighton",1894–95,"Leighton’s nickname, Jupiter Olympus, reflects his passion for the ancient Greek and Roman world. He derived this painting’s title from the Latin word for “tears.” The theme of sorrow is represented by a woman in dark robes standing beside a memorial with a withered wreath at her feet. Behind her is a cypress, a symbol of mourning and immortality, backlit by a funeral bonfire or a sunset. Emphatic vertical lines structure the composition and its frame, which Leighton designed. The artist exhibited the work withFlaming June(hanging nearby) at the Royal Academy in London in 1895. A critic there observed, “Flaming June[is] indicative of the joy of summer, andLachrymae, its antithesis, the falling tears of winter’s grief.”",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP124813.jpg
128,Bather in the Woods,Camille Pissarro,1895,"In summer 1893 Pissarro wrote his son Lucien that he was planning a series of canvases of nude peasant women bathing, even though he foresaw difficulties in engaging models in rural Eragny. None were completed until 1894, and Pissarro continued to paint variations on the theme through 1896. This picture falls midway in the project. Pissarro’s approach reflects the continuing influence of divisionist technique, but more naturalistic tendencies emerge in his attempts to capture the delicate fall of light over the grassy bank and the woman's back. Her pose recurs in two studies of a clothed model painted the same year.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT837.jpg
129,Still Life with Peaches,Auguste Renoir,1881,"Reviewers of the 1882 Impressionist exhibition were dazzled by this ""very appealing"" still life of ""a certain fruit bowl of 'Peaches,' whose velvety execution verges on a trompe l'oeil."" Painted the previous summer at the country house of Renoir’s patron Paul Berard, it is one of two still lifes that feature the same faïence jardinière; the other version also belongs to the Metropolitan Museum (56.218).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1140.jpg

This painting, one of more than two dozen for which Hortense posed, is set in the conservatory of Jas de Bouffan, the Cézanne family estate near Aix. The unfinished canvas offers a revealing glimpse into Cézanne’s working method. He placed Madame Cézanne’s carefully modeled head slightly off-center, cradled between a lush tree and a spindly plant, and then proceeded to build up the rest of the pyramidal composition, touch by exacting touch.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP317780.jpg

132,The Missionary's Adventures,Jean-Georges Vibert,ca. 1883,"Vibert is best known for his satirical scenes from ecclesiastical life. Here he draws a contrast between the inspired and modest missionary and the prelates in the midst of their comforts. The cardinals lounging on the sofa and purple-robed bishop savoring his tea are indifferent to the monk's account of his mission and to the wound he received carrying it out. Ribera's terrifyingMartyrdom of Saint Bartholomew(Museo del Prado, Madrid), on the wall in this luxurious interior, adds a harsh note of irony to the scene below it.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/EP1435.jpg

134,Ludus pro patria (Patriotic Games),Pierre Puvis de Chavannes,ca. 1883–89,"Puvis’s evocation of ancient France shows young athletes training with pikes (piquesin French), the traditional weapon of the Picardy region and reputedly the origin of the province’s name. One man has thrown his spear into the air and prepares to catch it—a rare moment of spontaneity in Puvis’s oeuvre. This work is a replica, reduced in size, of a mural that the painter completed in 1882 and installed in 1888 in the Musée de Picardie in Amiens. The exhibition and sale of such ""reductions"" helped publicize the artist’s monumental decorative commissions and boost his income.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14201-037.jpg
135,"Madame Cézanne (Hortense Fiquet, 1850–1922) in a Red Dress",Paul Cézanne,1888–90,"Of the four portraits that Cézanne painted of his wife wearing a shawl-collared red dress, this is the only one to show her in an elaborately furnished interior. Seated in a high-backed yellow chair and wedged between well-placed props that seem to bend to her form and shift to her weight, Madame Cézanne is the lynchpin of a tilting, spatially complex composition. The mottled blue wall, the dark red band that edges the wainscoting, and the mirror over the fireplace at left identify the setting as the apartment that Cézanne rented at 15 quai d’Anjou, Paris, from 1888 to 1890.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP320128.jpg
136,The Monet Family in Their Garden at Argenteuil,Edouard Manet,1874,"In July and August 1874 Manet vacationed at his family’s house in Gennevilliers, just across the Seine from Monet at Argenteuil. The two painters saw each other often that summer, and on a number of occasions they were joined by Renoir. While Manet was painting this picture of Monet with his wife Camille and their son Jean, Monet painted Manet at his easel (location unknown). Renoir, who arrived just as Manet was beginning to work, borrowed paint, brushes, and canvas, positioned himself next to Manet, and paintedMadame Monet and Her Son(National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.).",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-25465-001.jpg

In the Japanese-style sitting room of her Parisian townhouse—the décor and chic gown testifying to her stylish taste—Marguerite Charpentier sits beside her son, Paul. At age three, his locks are still uncut and, in keeping with current fashion, he is dressed identically to his sister Georgette, perched on the family dog. The well-connected publisher's wife, who hosted elite literary salons attended by such writers as Flaubert, the Goncourts, and Zola, used her influence to ensure that the painting enjoyed a choice spot at the Salon of 1879.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT49.jpg
138,The Spanish Singer,Edouard Manet,1860,"This painting, which reflects the Parisian vogue for Spanish art and culture during the Second Empire, won Manet his first popular and critical success in his debut at the Salon of 1861. Though the picture was admired for its realistic detail, Manet did not disguise the fact that it was composed in a studio using a model and props. The left-handed singer holds a guitar strung for a right-handed player, and his fingering suggests that he was unfamiliar with the instrument. His outfit was fashioned from costumes that Manet kept on hand; several accessories reappear in paintings in this gallery.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/dp130799.jpg
139,"Still Life with Jar, Cup, and Apples",Paul Cézanne,ca. 1877,"In addition to apples—a favorite motif of Cézanne’s—the ceramic jar and cup seen in this still life feature in numerous paintings by the artist. The wallpaper in the background appears in six works that he painted about 1877, when he rented an apartment at 67 rue de l’Ouest, Paris. Its pattern is echoed both by the shape of the white cloth on which the everyday items are arranged and by the painted floral decoration on the front of the wooden chest.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP130322.jpg
140,Landscape with a Sunlit Stream,Charles-François Daubigny,ca. 1877,"Daubigny began exhibiting his work regularly at the Salon in 1838, and by the early 1850s he had achieved considerable success as a landscape painter. Water figures prominently in his imagery—notably, in his riverscapes painted from the vantage point of his studio-boat.This painting's flickering brushwork and lightened palette relate it to the works of the Impressionists, whose influence on Daubigny grew out of his contact with Pissarro and Monet in the 1860s and early 1870s.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-23369-001.jpg
141,Dancers in the Rehearsal Room with a Double Bass,Edgar Degas,ca. 1882–85,"Degas used an elongated frieze format for more than forty rehearsal scenes made over the course of two decades. This is one of the first such works; it was preceded byThe Dance Lesson(ca. 1879, National Gallery of Art, Washington). Here, the angled wall in the foreground sets off the striking juxtaposition of a double bass and a seated dancer, bent over to tie the laces of her slipper. Technical analysis reveals that Degas painted the complex composition in virtually a single campaign with only minor revisions.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP275510.jpg
142,The Experts,Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps,1837,"In this satirical work, first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1839, elegantly dressed ""experts"" examine a landscape in the style of the seventeenth-century painter Nicolas Poussin. Decamps's generation, including such figures as Théodore Rousseau and Jules Dupré, sought to challenge the prevailing view that the art of the past should dictate contemporary taste.Scenes in which monkeys are engaged in human activities—singeriesin French—are part of a tradition that can be traced to Antiquity.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT209332.jpg
143,Cider,Pierre Puvis de Chavannes,ca. 1864,"Men grind grain while citizens of all ages prepare cider, one of the traditional beverages of the northern French province of Picardy. This painting andThe River(on view nearby) are studies for the left and right sides of Puvis’s muralAve Picardia Nutrix(Hail, Picardy, the Nourisher). Made for the newly constructed Musée de Picardie in Amiens in 1864, the paintings celebrate the region’s abundant natural resources and its idealized, distant past. Puvis’s decorations for the museum launched his career as a preeminent painter of murals for state buildings in France.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14201-027.jpg
144,The River,Pierre Puvis de Chavannes,ca. 1864,"In this painting andCider(26.46.1), Puvis developed his conception for a mural honoring the French territory of Picardy. Here, men construct a bridge over the Somme River while women bathe and mend fishing nets. Their draperies provide vivid accents of color amid the soft hues of the landscape.

145,The Environs of Paris,Camille Corot,1860s,"Corot painted at least four versions of this composition. The other three seem to predate this work of the mid-1860s by about a decade.

146,The Dispatch-Bearer,Giovanni Boldini,?1879,"Boldini made his debut at the Salon of 1879 with this vignette of contemporary urban life. The partially visible inscription of ""garde républicaine"" on the soldier’s bag indicates that he is delivering correspondence on behalf of the Parisian municipal guard. He has arrived so early that the concierge is still washing the sidewalk; a couple bids a discreet adieu at right. Large spectacles outside an optician’s shop encourage viewers to look closely at the action. One critic found the painting ""a bit nonchalant and glittering,"" but praised its sense of life and rapid motion, concluding, ""Boldini is more than a fashion painter.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP223662.jpg
147,Dancers Practicing at the Barre,Edgar Degas,1877,"The watering can, visible at left, was a standard fixture in ballet rehearsal rooms; water was sprinkled on the floor to keep dust from rising when ballerinas danced. Degas also used the watering can as a visual pun: its shape is mimicked by that of the dancer at right. Shown at the 1877 Impressionist exhibition, the painting was given by Degas to the collector Henri Rouart as a replacement for an earlier work (now lost), which the artist altered and accidentally destroyed. Louisine Havemeyer purchased it from Rouart's estate sale in 1912, for $95,700, a record price for a work by a living artist.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT840.jpg

For a year and a half Bonheur sketched there twice a week, dressing as a man to discourage attention. Bonheur was well established as an animal painter when the painting debuted at the Paris Salon of 1853, where it received wide praise. In arriving at the final scheme, the artist drew inspiration from George Stubbs, Théodore Gericault, Eugène Delacroix, and ancient Greek sculpture: she referred toThe Horse Fairas her own ""Parthenon frieze.""",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-23550-001.jpg

The steeple of the local church crowns the cluster of red-roofed buildings which animate the sloping terrain. Faceted and geometric, the structures anticipate early-twentieth-century Cubism.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14936-047.jpg
150,The Rehearsal Onstage,Edgar Degas,ca. 1874,"Of the two versions of this composition in the Museum’s collection, this one is more freely executed, indicating that it was probably made second. Several of the figures in this pastel differ from those inThe Rehearsal of the Ballet Onstage(29.160.26), including the dancer seen from behind on the far left, fingering her bracelet. Both works were executed over an ink drawing on paper, an unusual practice for Degas.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DT1006.jpg
151,George Sand's Garden at Nohant,Eugène Delacroix,ca. 1842–43,"During the 1840s Delacroix made three summer visits to Nohant in central France, where he stayed at the country home of his friend the writer Aurore Dudevant, better known by her pseudonym George Sand. This verdant view on the south side of the house, whose focal point is a simple stone table (or bench), was preceded by a pencil sketch that probably dates to 1842 or 1843 (Musée Carnavalet, Paris). One of Delacroix's rare pure landscapes, it was undoubtedly painted as a gift for Sand.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-14092-001.jpg
152,A Woman Reading,Camille Corot,1869 and 1870,"When the seventy-two-year-old Corot showedA Woman Readingat the Salon of 1869, the critic Théophile Gautier praised its naïveté and its color but criticized the faulty drawing of the woman, noting the rarity of figures in Corot’s work. Although the artist had painted similar studies for about a decade, this was the first and one of the very few that he exhibited. Corot returned to the canvas soon after the Salon; he reworked the landscape but left the figure intact.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-16589-001.jpg
153,Flowers in a Grotesque Vase,Orsola Maddalena Caccia,ca. 1635,"Caccia ran a painting studio that supported a convent at Moncalvo founded by her father, the painter Guglielmo Caccia (1568–1625). The strongly individuated elements evenly distributed across a monochrome background result in a captivating effect of surface pattern. These features were well suited to religious meditation and were probably derived from her study of Northern European botanical prints.",https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/ep/original/DP-19714-001.jpg
